# Twttr

This is one half of the coding challenge - just the front end. The other half is [here](https://github.com/pash90/public-twitter-browser).

This project is the source for browsing the public user accounts on Twitter.

## Steps

1. After cloning the directory, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to run the project. It'll be live at http://localhost:3000
